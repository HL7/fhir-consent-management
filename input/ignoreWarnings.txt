== Suppressed Messages ==

# 01 -This IG is based on hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 due to CMS regulation stating that systems must conform to 6.1.0
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# 02 - We don't have narratives on the parameters.
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management (text.`div`.exists())' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# 03 - We have checked that the LOINC Consent codes are in the US Core Doc Ref Type value set
Unable to check if http://hl7.org/fhir/us/consent-management/ValueSet/LOINCConsentDocumentTypes is a proper subset of http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-documentreference-type - value set is too large to check

# 04 - Messages due to definitions from the base spec or US Core or IHE guides
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/consent-state-codes|4.0.1
Reference to experimental CodeSystem http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/extra-security-role-type|1.0.1
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'

# 05 - An example URL for a Questionnaire for the purposes of this guide's examples
The questionnaire 'http://example.org/fhir/Questionnaire/Simple-Consent-Form' could not be resolved, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# 06 - Core value sets that are pinned to a specific version
Pinned the version of http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse to 3.1.0 from choices of 2.0.0 (hl7.terminology.r4#5.3.0), 3.1.0 (hl7.terminology.r4#6.5.0)
Pinned the version of http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode to 3.0.0 from choices of 2.0.0 (hl7.terminology.r4#5.3.0), 3.0.0 (hl7.terminology.r4#6.5.0)

# 07 - US Core has an inconsistent Must Support slice in v6
The slice 'uscore' on path 'DocumentReference.category' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

# 08 - We are using the R4 Subscriptions Backport IG which is 4.0.0
This IG is version 4.0.1, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4' is from version 4.0.0
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package hl7.fhir.uv.subscriptions-backport.r4#1.1.0 is based on FHIR version 4.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try

# 10 - The code is 'cbcc', but the publisher wants cbcc in the url but it should be homehealth. (https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/CBCC.20vs.20Homehealth/with/560287669)
The nominated WG 'cbcc' means that the contact url should be 'http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/cbcc' but it was not found
