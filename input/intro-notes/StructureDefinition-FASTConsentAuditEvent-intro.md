### Referencing External Participants

Since a FHIR reference can contain a RESTful id to a patient, organization, practitioner, or related person, and those RESTful ids may not be useful once an Audit Event instance has propogated to other consent servers, this guide requires that an external identifier for those participants SHALL be populated.  The RESTful id can also be sent but it is not necessary since the mandatory identifier conveys the identity of the participant.  The FHIR additionalIdentifier extension is also included in the Reference to allow for multiple identifiers for participants to be conveyed.
