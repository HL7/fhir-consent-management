### Delegate Consent

**Actor:** Consenter

**Pre-condition:**

**Narrative:**
By navigating and signing a delegation form, the consenter assigns a delegate to sign and file a consent on their behalf. 

**Post-condition:**
- Notices to collect consent from the the original consenter would be routed to the delegate. 

- The delegate may also be able to revoke the consent. This may depend on the conditions of delegation as decided by the consenter, or by overarching policies. 

- The audit must record accurately whether a consent was filed by the consenter or the delegate.

- The delegate may be assigned through other mechanisms such as a court order. These alternatives are outside the scope of this IG although the effect is the same.

**Notes:**
- conditions and limitations on the scope of the power of a delegate may apply based on overarching policies.
