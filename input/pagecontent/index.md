### Introduction
This guide details the consent management use cases as well as the required custom FHIR operations and profiles to exchange the required consent data elements both between the user and the consent mangement repository as well as between repositories.  This includes the interactions between patients and the consent management system in the process of soliciting, navigating, and executing consents, which is sometimes referred to as consent ceremony, as well as a high-level API (e.g., defining custom FHIR operations) to cover use cases for consent management.

### Rationale
There is currently some support for some basic consent management use cases in the existing specifications, including FHIR Core and the IHE.ITI Privacy Consent on FHIR (PCF), mostly at the basic operations for creating, reading, and updating consent resources. Consent management, however, needs more implementation guidance and standardized specifications that are still missing. This includes the interactions between patients and the consent management system in the process of soliciting, navigating, and executing consents, which is sometimes referred to as consent ceremony, as well as a high-level API (e.g., defining custom FHIR operations) to cover use cases for consent management.


### Use Cases
Patient Consent management is the central component in a consent ecosystem and at the core of a scalable consent architecture.  This project is about answering the question "is it possible to determine if payer/provider X have authority to view healthcare data Y about patient Z?".  This FAST project will be dealing with how to handle the use cases across a set of consent management repositories in a scaleable fashion.

Our initial set of potential use cases are:

1. Provider-Initiated Request to Consent
2. Patient-Initiated Consent
3. Review Consent
4. File/Sign Consent
5. Delegate Consent
6. Revoke Consent
7. Propagation of Revocation
8. Disclosure Audit
9. Query Consent Decision
10. Enforce Consent Decision

NOTE: The actual authentication (is the consumer who they say they are) and data authorization (does the consumer have access to patient health data) is not in scope of this IG. We will provide the operations to gather and request consent and answer the question on whether a consumer has been granted consent to a patient's specific set healthcare data. The question of whether the consumer can actually access a patient's health data based on legal, corporate, and other policies and the granted consent is not in scope.

### Definitions

**Consent**: The [FHIR Consent resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/consent.html) defines consent as "A record of a healthcare consumerâ€™s choices or choices made on their behalf by a third party, which permits or denies identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time." For the purposes of this Implementation Guide, we further constrain the definition to only include policies / actions pertaining to granting access to data associated with a patient. In this context it does not include patient wishes, such as consent for treatment or Do Not Resuscitate orders.

**Authorization**: The process of granting access to data. The broader question of authorization is NOT in scope for this project, except that portion which overlaps with "Query Consent Decision" and "Enforce Consent Decision" above. 

**Authentication**: The process of assuring a user's identity. This is NOT in scope for this project.

### Content and Organization
This implementation guide (and the menu for it) is organized into the following sections:

* *Background* - Supporting informative pages that do not set conformance expectations
  * [Reading this IG](background.html) points to key pages in the FHIR spec and other source specifications that must be understood in order to understand this guide
  * *Use Case Pages - each use case page describes the intent use case, gives examples of its use, and provides a high-level overview of expected process flow
  * [Project and Participants](credits.html) gives a high-level overview of FAST and identifies the individuals and organizations involved in developing this implementation guide
* *Specification* - Pages that set conformance expectations
  * [Conformance Expectations](conformance.html) defines base language and expectations for declaring conformance with the guide
  * [Technical Specification](technical.html) defines the specific conformance requirements for systems wishing to conform to this implementation guide.
  * [Privacy, Safety, and Security](privacy.html) covers considerations around data access, protection, and similar concepts that apply to all implementations
* *FHIR Artifacts*
  * [Overview](fhirArtifacts.html) introduces and provides links to the profiles, search parameters and other FHIR artifacts used in this implementation guide
  * [Artifacts](artifacts.html) points to the complete list of artifacts defined in this guide
* *Base Specifications* - Quick links to the various specifications this guide derives from
* *Support* - Links to help with use of this guide
  * *Discussion Forum* is a place to ask questions about the guide, discuss potential issues, and search through prior discussions
  * *Project Home* includes information about project calls, agendas, past minutes, and instructions for how to participate
  * *Project Dashoard* shows new and historical issues that have been logged against the specification, proposed dispositions, unapplied changes, etc.
  * *Propose a Change* allows formal submission of requests for change to the specification.  (Consider raising on the discussion forum first.)
  * [Downloads](downloads.html) allows download of this and other specifications, as well as other useful files

### Dependencies

At present, FAST Consent is based on [FHIR R4]({{site.data.fhir.path}}).  In addition, PAS is dependent on the [US Core 6.1 (FHIR R4)]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}) implementation guides.  

In addition, this guide uses content from the following FHIR-related specifications and implementation guides:
* [Subscriptions R5 Backport]({{site.data.fhir.ver.subscriptions}})
* [IHE Privacy Consent on FHIR]({{site.data.fhir.ver.iheconsent}})

In addition, this guide also relies on a number of parent implementation guides:

This implementation guide defines additional constraints and usage expectations above and beyond the information found in these base specifications.

### Intellectual Property Considerations
This implementation guide and the underlying FHIR specification are licensed as public domain under the [FHIR license](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/license.html#license). The license page also describes rules for the use of the FHIR name and logo.
