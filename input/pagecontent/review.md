### Review Consent

**Actor:** Consenter

**Pre-Condition:**
A consent capture is initiated (see use case X).


**Narrative:**
As a consenter, I want to be able to navigate the consent management system and review a consent form (could be digitized form, scanned pdf/image etc) to make appropriate choices, express my preferences or make changes time to time in sharing my clinical data with other interested entities. Once a consent selection is made, the requested decision or action needs to take place which could lead to a store or update consent in the repository with proper timestamp and same needs to be propagate and notified to the external entities depending on this consent management system.

- The consenter views the consent form. 

- If the form is arranged as multiple pages, the consenter can navigate all the pages by moving forward and backward.

- The consenter can review the options available in each page and enter a response thereby communicating a decision. The response shall be retained as the consenter navigates between pages. 

- The consenter can save the incomplete form and log out of the application.

- Once logging back in and retrieving the form the last-saved state shall be visible to the consenter.

- The consenter shall be able to see what mandatory fields remain in the form and await response as they navigate the form.

- The consenter shall be able to see whether the form is complete and ready for signing and submission as they navigate the form

- Any information known to the session (such as the consenter's name, DoB, or current date and time) should be pre-filled in the form to minimize the effort for the consenter.

**Post-condition:**
A completed consent form ready is available for submission.
