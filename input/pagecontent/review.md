**FAST Consent: Review Consent Use Case**

As a patient or a patient authorized representative, I want to be able to navigate the consent management system and review a consent form (could be digitized form, scanned pdf/image etc) to make appropriate choices, express my preferences or make changes time to time in sharing my clinical data with other interested entities. Once a consent selection is made, the requested decision or action needs to take place which could lead to a store or update consent in the repository with proper timestamp and same needs to be propagate and notified to the external entities depending on this consent management system.
